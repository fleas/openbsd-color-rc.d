just added color to openbsd's new rc.d (8) that let's you restart daemons - nothing special but whoopee.

The function I added tests to see if your terminal supports color. If it does it uses "tput setval 1" to set the colored output.
right now we just colorize the rc_exit output that says "ok". similar to linux /etc/init.d/service restart.

If you want to use it, I recommend you back up /etc/rc.d/rc.subr and copy this file in place. That's it ! Once you restart a daemon
you should see the output similar to what you are used to in linux.

Enjoy.
